# NQueens
A Python solution to the N Queens problem

A friend of mine told me about this problem, so I decided to find a solution for it myself. The values it gave me were

| N  | unique | total | time (s)          |
|----|--------|-------|-------------------|
| 1  | 1      | 1     | 0.0               |
| 2  | 0      | 0     | 0.000999927520752 |
| 3  | 0      | 0     | 0.00100016593933  |
| 4  | 1      | 2     | 0.00399994850159  |
| 5  | 2      | 10    | 0.00999999046326  |
| 6  | 1      | 4     | 0.0209999084473   |
| 7  | 6      | 40    | 0.0820000171661   |
| 8  | 12     | 92    | 0.272000074387    |
| 9  | 46     | 352   | 1.09299993515     |
| 10 | 92     | 724   | 4.45200014114     |
| 11 | 341    | 2680  | 22.5130000114     |
| 12 | 1787   | 14200 | 112.617000103     |

It may not be the most efficient code, but I cannot find many more ways to improve it.
